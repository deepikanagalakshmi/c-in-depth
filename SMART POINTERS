SMART POINTERS

In traditional pointers we need to use new and delete
NEW- Allocates a memory
DELETE - Deallocates a memory

With new keyword, delete is must to used but, some times developers forget to use delete keyword 
which may lead to memory leeks and serious security issues this is where SMART POINTERS comes in place.

To use smart pointers must include <memory> header file

#include <memory>

some compailers may not support smart pointers
